This plugin experiments with providing a Moodle message provider plugin for Signal.

## Dependencies
This plugin sends messages over a signal-cli-api that has to be self-hosted since there is no official Signal-API.
To host such an api you can use the code in the following repository. A docker image is also provided for easier installation.
https://github.com/pascalhuerten/signal-cli-api

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/pascalhuerten/moodle_signal.git
